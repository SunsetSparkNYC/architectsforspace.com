                <p>Hi PAZ students,</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess if you're reading this, that means you received your ID cards and figured out how to log in.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time to move on to the hard work. I think the best thing to do is to learn about what makes Earth special. A lot of people think our planet is unique among all the other billions of planets in the universe, but scientists are beginning to find lots of exoplanets that look similar to Earth.</p>
                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Gaelen, why don't you start by teaching the students what makes Earth habitable?</p>
                <p>-Vanessa</p>
